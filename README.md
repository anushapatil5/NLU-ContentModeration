# NLU-ContentModeration
For performing the analysis of Pretraining RoBERTa for Content Moderation on Social Media, 
we propose a RoBERTa model trained on comments from a specific subreddit and fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of flagged comments from that subreddit to create an automatic comment-flagging model specific to the rules of a given subreddit.
